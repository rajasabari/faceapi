# lightweight-webcam-javascript-face-detection

This is a comparison of different javascript face detection libraries available for real-time webcam analysis in the browser. These are static implementations that do not require processing from the server-side. The aim of this work is to start from the simplest and cleanest implementations that do not require node.js installation. The original demos available on each library have tons of extra styles and libraries that do not add extra value to the main functionality.

Libraries implemented:

* pico.js
* opencv.js
* face.api.js
